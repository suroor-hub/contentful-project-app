            To reduce CMS development risks, time, and costs, we suggest
            applying an iterative approach to development and introducing CI/CD
            pipelines. Thus, a new CMS iteration is delivered every 2â€“3 weeks.
            The approach actively engages stakeholders early on to guarantee
            better user satisfaction and control over the delivery results.
